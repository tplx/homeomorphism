## Determining Homeomorphism

To determine if two topological spaces are homeomorphic, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Spaces**: Define your topological spaces by specifying their points and open sets. See `Space` for more details on creating `Space` instances.

2. **Define the Homeomorphism**: Define the bijective mapping functions that potentially create a homeomorphism between your spaces. You will need both the function and its inverse. The functions should be provided as `std::function<double(double)>` objects.

3. **Create a `Homeomorphism` Instance**: Pass your spaces and the mapping functions to the `Homeomorphism` constructor.

4. **Validate the Homeomorphism**: Call `isValid()` on the `Homeomorphism` instance to check if your mapping functions indeed establish a homeomorphism between the provided spaces.

## Understanding the Results

- If `isValid()` returns `true`, the spaces are homeomorphic.
- If `isValid()` returns `false`, the spaces are not homeomorphic, or the functions provided do not establish a homeomorphism. You may need to recheck your spaces and functions for correctness.

## Important Caveats

- The library assumes the topological spaces are subsets of the real number line, `\mathbb{R}`, with standard topology.
- All spaces are treated as Hausdorff spaces, as this is true for subsets of `\mathbb{R}`.
- The `isContinuous` function uses a basic epsilon-delta definition of continuity and may not be suitable for complex spaces or functions.

## Example: Verifying Homeomorphism

```cpp
#include "homeomorphism.hpp"

// Step 1: Define the topological spaces
std::set<double> points1 = { /* set of points for space1 */ };
std::set<std::set<double>> openSets1 = { /* set of open sets for space1 */ };
std::set<double> points2 = { /* set of points for space2 */ };
std::set<std::set<double>> openSets2 = { /* set of open sets for space2 */ };

topology::Space space1(points1, openSets1);
topology::Space space2(points2, openSets2);

// Step 2: Define the homeomorphism functions
std::function<double(double)> f = [](double x) { /* define function */ };
std::function<double(double)> fInverse = [](double x) { /* define inverse function */ };

// Step 3: Create a Homeomorphism object
topology::Homeomorphism homeomorphism(f, fInverse, space1, space2);

// Step 4: Validate the homeomorphism
bool areHomeomorphic = homeomorphism.isValid();

if (areHomeomorphic) {
    std::cout << "The spaces are homeomorphic." << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "The spaces are not homeomorphic." << std::endl;
}
