# Class `Homeomorphism`

## Overview

The `Homeomorphism` class is used to define a potential homeomorphism between two topological spaces and validate its properties.

## Constructors

- `Homeomorphism(std::function<double(double)> function, std::function<double(double)> inverse, Space domain, Space range)`: Constructs a `Homeomorphism` given the mapping function, its inverse, and the two spaces being tested.

## Member Functions

- `bool isValid()`: Verifies if the constructed homeomorphism is valid by checking bijectivity, continuity, and the preservation of open and closed sets.
- `bool preservesOpenSets(std::function<double(double)> f, Space domain, Space range)`: Checks if a function preserves open sets.
- `bool preservesClosedSets(std::function<double(double)> f, Space domain, Space range)`: Checks if a function preserves closed sets.
- `bool isContinuous(std::function<double(double)> f, std::set<double> domain)`: Checks if a function is continuous.
- `bool isBijective(Space domain, Space range)`: Verifies if a function is bijective between two spaces.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include "homeomorphism.hpp"

// Assume space1 and space2 have been defined (see SpaceClass.mdx for reference)

// Define the homeomorphism functions between space1 and space2
std::function<double(double)> homeoFunc = [](double x) { return 2 * x; };
std::function<double(double)> inverseFunc = [](double x) { return x / 2; };

// Create a Homeomorphism object
topology::Homeomorphism homeomorphism(homeoFunc, inverseFunc, space1, space2);

// Check if the homeomorphism is valid
bool isValidHomeo = homeomorphism.isValid();
